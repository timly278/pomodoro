# Pomodoro

This Pomodoro Application is backend only. It provides APIs for FrontEnd app to use and build client application. [Link to APIs swagger](http://18.140.71.34/swagger/index.html).<br>
In this project I used:
- Backend Language: ```Golang```
- Database: `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`
- Framework: `Gin`, sqlc, uber-fx (for dependency injection), uber-zap (for logging files)
- Deployment: `AWS EC2`, Nginx

The general idea of GUI of the application would look like this:

The fullstack application code will be released soon. Thank you for visiting!
